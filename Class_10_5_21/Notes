if-else statements 

if(boolean_condition){
   //code in here runs if the boolean condition is true
}

else{
   //code in here runs if boolean condition(s) is not true 
}

example in method:
public int ----- (int num)
{

   if (num<0) 
   {
      //brackets are required if there is more than 1 line and strongly reccomended for multiple lines
      return num;
   }
   
   else 
   {
      //else statement is required here because if not the method may not return anything
      return 0;
   }
   
}
